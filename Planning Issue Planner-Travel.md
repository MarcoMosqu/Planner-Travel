Planning Issue Travel Planner Project. 
Goal:

Prepare the project for the next development phase by improving its structure, code quality, and maintainability.

* Refactoring

  - Review class design and overall architecture.

  - Simplify and reorganize code for clarity and efficiency.

  - Optimize memory usage and performance where possible.

* Testing

   - Add unit tests for key classes and core logic.

   - Check basic test coverage and fix failing cases.

* Inheritances and polymorphism
   
   - Review and update existing inheritance structures.

   - Improve the use of subclass overriding behavior.

   - Enhance recursive methods in interfaces for robustness.

   - Ensure a clear and enforceable contract through abstract classes or interfaces.
   

* GUI Driiven 

   - Review and improve the existing GUI components and flows.

   - Ensure that all necessary GUI-driven methods are implemented and integrated.

   - Focus on making the interface user-friendly, responsive, and consistent with the project’s narrative.

   - Maintain clear separation between GUI logic and core model logic for easier future maintenance.


* Documentation

   - Update existing documentation and add brief explanations where needed.
   

* Maintenance

   - Review dependencies and project structure.

   - Ensure the codebase is ready for future features.
